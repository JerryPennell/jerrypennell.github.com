                              Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. 
                              How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?                
                          </strong>
                          </p>
                        <p>
                              Twitter could be used for &lsquo;live&rsquo; data resources for logins and payments for many various ways. 
                              One not so obvious way Twitter could be used for a login is for when you check-in to four square. When you 
                              log in or &lsquo;check in&rsquo; it lets your friends know your participating. As for payments you might want 
                              to receive a coupon code prior to your next payment on an item.

                            <strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             JSON-P would be used for script injection. JSON with padding allows you to get around security by using a 
                             HTTP GET. While JSON-P appears less secure if implemented correctly proves useful in proof of concept 
                             development too. JSON-P simply wraps the response in a function call named by the programmer. Cross origin 
                             resource sharing is the strength behind JSON-P. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which 
                            types of Native device features?
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                               JSON-P with a movie theater API could be used in a Native device map feature. It would work well if 
                               your using geo-location searches for movies that are being shown close by. Best Buy API would be great for 
                               this geo-location search too.
                        </p>

                              I would like to pull in Twitter feeds based on criteria the users wants for my demo. In addition I would like to 
                              try pulling images related to the same topic maybe based on geo-location. 
                        </p>

                             <strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, 
                             development, etc.
                             </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest lessons learned is I tried to implement Backbone JS within Cloudant. While it is good to 
                            branch out and learn things it is never a good idea while under a tight deadline. I am now working with another 
                            developer to come up with better examples for people like myself in future projects. Most of my work now also is done 
                            agile with less technical workflow diagrams and more business workflow. I have found that this helps in the agile 
                            process while meeting the business need.

                    <p>Using semantic HTML markup along with your own custom design and functionality, create a mobile webpage that will serve as the Launch Page of the AVF Demo app. This Launch Page will showcase your work throughout the month. Pay close attention as each week will have additional requirements in content, design, and functionality.</p>
