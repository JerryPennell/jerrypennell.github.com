                               What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? 
                               (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)
                             </strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One way my app could be more accessible is using alt tags so screen readers will pick up more information. 
                            In addition to the alt tags perhaps using text to speech searches for my input areas would help people who have a 
                            hard time typing.
                            <br>

                            <strong>
                               Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for &quot;Screen Reader Demo&quot; and &quot;Mobile 
                               Screen Reader&quot; - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among 
                               the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
                            </strong>

                            One of the problems I see is with dynamic content it never seems to finish reading the whole page. The reader also 
                            is extremely fast-talking which for disabled or elderly can be a problem to process. The reader is constantly 
                            interrupted when using the root setting. So with some calibration it works but not as well as it can due to 
                            development issues.
