                        <h2>Discussion Post</h2>
                        <p><strong>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</strong>                        
                        <p><br>
                        The top categories that seem to penetrate the market the most relevant to U.S., Japan and Great Britain are with personalization, navigation and entertainment. Angry birds led as one of the top games in all markets and platforms but did not make the top 10 in most cases. Entertainment came up as being solid in all markets where as the secondary category varied.                        
                        <p><br>
                        U.S. markets led with personalization and entertainment with Facebook, twitter and camera applications according an article by Craig Grannell of top 70 Free apps in 2012.                        
                        <p><br>
                        In Japan the app “Gang Street Wars” according to a Tech Crunch article led for sometime in 2009 with entertainment. Entertainment is now ranking second with今すぐ使えるワル知恵２００as the second app that denotes a interactive comic for reading. App Annie a mobile ranking website shows a voice translator application now as its top app.                         
                        <p><br>
                        In Great Britain, a news app made headlines as a top app. News Technology (2 November 2012 Last updated at 08:45 ET) talks about how a 17 year old has created a better app for navigating the news. The app Summly is more of a “navigation” app due to its nature of how it allows the user to navigate news easier.                         
                        <p><br>
                        In researching the categories the interesting mark is the market is also event driven. USA Today magazine cites an example of event driven apps that climbed to the top of the charts was disaster apps.                         
                        <p><br>
                        USA Today section about money (2011) notes that “Not surprisingly, since Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami a week ago, the 99-cent QuakeWatch app (also available for the iPad) has rocketed to the top of the paid news apps chart, now No. 1 in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada and other countries.”( USA Today, Pg. 03b)                        
                        <p><br>
                        <strong>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</strong>                        
                        <p><br>
                        The U.S. market seems to be more centric about social and entertainment app delivery. The trend has been solid due to media penetration with movies, music and the Western culture.                        
                        <p><br>
                        In Japan as global business increases this has put a translator app as its number one spot. Japan has always been a business driven culture with technology on a continuous growth.                         
                        <p><br>
                        Great Britain appears to have news and entertainment driven apps that help reflect those of the Western culture. One might infer that they are influenced by the U.S. greatly when it comes to media and uses news to inform them of the changes.                         
                        <p><strong><br>
                        What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</strong><br>
                        <p><strong>The bandwidth averages per market are as follows:</strong>                        
                      <p><br>
                          * Japan: 15.22 Mbps upload and 38.05 Mbps dowload<br>
                          * Great Britain:  3.42 Mbps upload and 18.59 Mbps down <br>
                      * U.S: 4.00 Mbps upload and 15.39 down                                                 
                        <p><strong><br>
                      The Average costs are as follows:</strong>                        
                        <p><br>
                          * Japan:  Varies from study to study but shows less than US @approx &lt; $4.00USD<br>
                          * Great Britain: $3.37 USD<br>
                      * U.S:  $4.42 USD                        
                        <p><br>
                          Development will be impacted most within Great Britain with having to develop applications that will cache or have light graphics. Development in Japan seems to be good but this is believed to be due to the digital television market increase. The U.S. while small has many locations that are continuing growth and may improve as infrastructure becomes available. Overall limitations seem to be on the download where pulling data could be a factor. Information provided by netindex.com helped determine these key assessments. 
                      <p>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.<br>
                      </p>
                        <p>My suggestive strategy to build an app for a global market would be a social app that reflects entertainment, business and current news. I feel this is why apps like Twitter, Facebook and News syndication are ranked as the top grossing formulas for succession. The app should be ridged but flexible that it takes your location in play giving you the choices you choose. The flexibility should be that you can share with friends in different regions so they are within your network too. Social applications are packages that bring users by using everyone to market anyone. </p>
                        <p>The second choice for an global application is an entertainment app that translates humor amongst everyone. Getting everyone on the same platform of language helps unify the visual message. A prime example is the video of “Gangam Style” that is a world sensation of audio and visual. While the beat of music brings us closer the words can give greater impact. I think an app that could provide a translation to YouTube or visual context would be invaluable. </p>
